- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheAlchemist47
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in biotechnology, machine learning, farming and cooking!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and R toward chemo and bioinformatic application.
I am a hardcore scientist with chemistry and chemical engineering background. I'm also building a small farm as a hobby.
As of now, coding has nothing to do with my profession.
Here is to learning!
